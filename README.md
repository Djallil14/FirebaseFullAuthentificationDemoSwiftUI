# FirebaseFullAuthentificationDemoSwiftUI
This project is work in progress, should be finished very soon.
The main goal is to have firebase auth with email and sign in with apple (might add other providers later) with error handling to give a good
reusability base for my projects that need auth, i hope it will help other people than want to implant it cleanly in SwiftUI.

iOS14+
Xcode 14
